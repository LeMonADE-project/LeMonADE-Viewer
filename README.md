# LeMonADE-Viewer
The abbreviation LeMonADE stands for 
"**L**attice-based **e**xtensible **Mon**te-Carlo **A**lgorithm and **D**evelopment **E**nvironment"
and "Viewer" refers to the visualization module.

The aim of the application LeMonADE-Viewer is to provide a simplistic visualization tool
for rendering the bond-fluctuation-model [1] [BFM1] [2] [BFM2] data generated by the LeMonADE-project [3] [LeMonADE-project].
